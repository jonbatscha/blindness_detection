# APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection

see kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/aptos2019-blindness-detection

## Goal

Given images of retina scans, build a model that accurately classifies the level of degeneration

## Approach

I used this competition as an opportunity to experiment with the [`fastai`](https://docs.fast.ai/index.html) vision library, particularly the built-in data augmentation tools.
